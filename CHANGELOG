0.05	8 September 2006
	Removed dependency of Data::Alias: as Matthijs pointed out, there
	is no need for Data::Alias as a simple glob => glob assignment at
	compile time does the same.

0.04	8 September 2006
	Fixed problem with reloading modules time and time again.
	Fixed problem with using -require- for version checks.
	Aliased generic "import" method instead of creating a new one

	Fixed problem with return value of -require-.

0.02	7 September 2006
	First version based on Data::Alias and uploaded to CPAN.
